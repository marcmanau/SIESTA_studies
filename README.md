# SIESTA_studies

In this folder we can find files related to different SIESTA examples.

The "STM" folder contains the resulting files of the SIESTA simulation for the optimization of the benzene structure to be used on the STM images simulation. In the folder "analysis" is the visualization of the simulated STM images with VMD.  

The "benzene" file contains the generated benzene molecule using VMD builder and its optimization using SIESTA. While "Molecula" folder contains a modified structure of the benzene with some functional groups added, and the structures corresponding to the original benzene and Si, with other extra files that are usuful for the simulations.

The "Crystal" folder contains the relaxation simulation using SIESTA for the silicon crystall.

The "Band structure" folder contains the files related to the simulation and Python code to visualize the band structure of graphene.
